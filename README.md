# Getting_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project

This repo was created as part of "Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project" under Week 4 - Coursera's Data Science Specialization

Project Background -
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

This repo's README.md explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected -

1) Dataset - Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip]

2) CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data

3) run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps

4) The output after the 5th step is written in a file called "averages_data.txt"
